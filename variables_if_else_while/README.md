# This directory contains the tasks of the project C - Variables , if, else,

## 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored
in the vagriable n is positive or negative.


-  The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this
    program
    - You donâ€™t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not
 touch this code
    - The output of the program should be:
    - The number, followed by
        - if the number is greater than 0: is positive
        - if the number is 0: is zero
        - if the number is less than 0: is negative
        - followed by a new line

$ ./0-positive_or_negative
