# C - Makefiles.

## Recomendation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I highly suggest to use makefiles for big projects like your own shell or advanced
> fucntions like your own printf, unless you want to re-open the makefile everytime
> you finish a task.

> [!TIP]
> You can use a bash script to somehow  emulate the make command but again, if it is a big
> projectthe makefiles are the best option.
